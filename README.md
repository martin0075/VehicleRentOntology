## :pencil: About The Project
The Vehicle Rent Ontology was developed to model the domain related to vehicle rental listings using Semantic Web technologies. This project aims to represent vehicle rental information in a structured and semantic way, improving the efficiency of managing listings, allowing for more precise searches, and providing more relevant results for users.

## :cloud: Overview
The Vehicle Rent Ontology project focuses on the development of a standardized framework for knowledge representation related to vehicle rental listings. This project encompasses two files: an RDFS file and an OWL file, which serve as the foundation of the ontology. The ontology incorporates relevant information from GoodRelations, FOAF, and Vehicle Sales Ontology, ensuring a comprehensive representation of concepts, relationships, and properties related to vehicle rental listings. By leveraging these existing ontologies, the Vehicle Rent Ontology project promotes consistency and interoperability within the domain of knowledge representation for vehicle rentals.
